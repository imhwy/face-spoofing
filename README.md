# Face Spoofing Detection

This project is designed to detect face spoofing attempts using a deep learning-based approach. We use the Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Networks (MTCNN) for face detection and implement an anti-spoofing function to distinguish between real and spoofed faces.

## Introduction

Face spoofing is a technique used to deceive face recognition systems using photos, videos, or masks of an authorized person. This project aims to enhance the security of face recognition systems by implementing an anti-spoofing module that can identify and prevent such spoofing attempts.

## Features

- Face detection using MTCNN
- Anti-spoofing detection function
- Easy-to-use interface for testing

## Installation

To get started with this project, you need to have Python installed on your system. Follow the steps below to set up the project:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/imhwy/face-spoofing.git
    cd face-spoofing
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

    ```bash
    python -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`
    ```

## Usage

To use the face spoofing detection system, run the `test.py` script:

```bash
python test.py
```

## Contributing to Face Spoofing Detection

We welcome contributions to enhance the functionality and performance of this project. To contribute, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.

2. Create a new branch for your feature or bugfix.

3. Commit your changes and push them to your branch.

4. Create a pull request with a detailed description of your changes.

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.

2. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations, and container parameters.

3. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).

4. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of one other developer, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.
